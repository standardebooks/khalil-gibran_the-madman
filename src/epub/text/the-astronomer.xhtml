			<h2 epub:type="title">The Astronomer</h2>
			<p>In the shadow of the temple my friend and I saw a blind man sitting alone. And my friend said, “Behold the wisest man of our land.”</p>
			<p>Then I left my friend and approached the blind man and greeted him. And we conversed.</p>
			<p>After a while I said, “Forgive my question; but since when has thou been blind?”</p>
			<p>“From my birth,” he answered.</p>
			<p>Said I, “And what path of wisdom followest thou?”</p>
			<p>Said he, “I am an astronomer.”</p>
			<p>Then he placed his hand upon his breast saying, “I watch all these suns and moons and stars.”</p>

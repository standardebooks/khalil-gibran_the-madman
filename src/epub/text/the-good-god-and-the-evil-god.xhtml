			<p>The Good God and the Evil God met on the mountain top.</p>
			<p>The Good God said, “Good day to you, brother.”</p>
			<p>The Evil God did not answer.</p>
			<p>And the Good God said, “You are in a bad humour today.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said the Evil God, “for of late I have been often mistaken for you, called by your name, and treated as if I were you, and it ill-pleases me.”</p>
			<p>And the Good God said, “But I too have been mistaken for you and called by your name.”</p>
			<p>The Evil God walked away cursing the stupidity of man.</p>

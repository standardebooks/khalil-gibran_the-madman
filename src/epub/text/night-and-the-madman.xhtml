			<h2 epub:type="title">Night and the Madman</h2>
			<p>“I am like thee, O, Night, dark and naked; I walk on the flaming path which is above my daydreams, and whenever my foot touches earth a giant oak tree comes forth.”</p>
			<p>“Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou still lookest backward to see how large a footprint thou leavest on the sand.”</p>
			<p>“I am like thee, O, Night, silent and deep; and in the heart of my loneliness lies a Goddess in childbed; and in him who is being born Heaven touches Hell.”</p>
			<p>“Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou shudderest yet before pain, and the song of the abyss terrifies thee.”</p>
			<p>“I am like thee, O, Night, wild and terrible; for my ears are crowded with cries of conquered nations and sighs for forgotten lands.”</p>
			<p>“Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou still takest thy little-self for a comrade, and with thy monster-self thou canst not be friend.”</p>
			<p>“I am like thee, O, Night, cruel and awful; for my bosom is lit by burning ships at sea, and my lips are wet with blood of slain warriors.”</p>
			<p>“Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman; for the desire for a sister-spirit is yet upon thee, and thou has not become alone unto thyself.”</p>
			<p>“I am like thee, O, Night, joyous and glad; for he who dwells in my shadow is now drunk with virgin wine, and she who follows me is sinning mirthfully.”</p>
			<p>“Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thy soul is wrapped in the veil of seven folds and thou holdest not thy heart in thine hand.”</p>
			<p>“I am like thee, O, Night, patient and passionate; for in my breast a thousand dead lovers are buried in shrouds of withered kisses.”</p>
			<p>“Yea, Madman, art thou like me? Art thou like me? And canst thou ride the tempest as a steed, and grasp the lightning as a sword?”</p>
			<p>“Like thee, O, Night, like thee, mighty and high, and my throne is built upon heaps of fallen Gods; and before me too pass the days to kiss the hem of my garment but never to gaze at my face.”</p>
			<p>“Art thou like me, child of my darkest heart? And dost thou think my untamed thoughts and speak my vast language?”</p>
			<p>“Yea, we are twin brothers, O, Night; for thou revealest space and I reveal my soul.”</p>

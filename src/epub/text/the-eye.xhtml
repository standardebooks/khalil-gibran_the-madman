			<h2 epub:type="title">The Eye</h2>
			<p>Said the Eye one day, “I see beyond these valleys a mountain veiled with blue mist. Is it not beautiful?”</p>
			<p>The Ear listened, and after listening intently awhile, said, “But where is any mountain? I do not hear it.”</p>
			<p>Then the Hand spoke and said, “I am trying in vain to feel it or touch it, and I can find no mountain.”</p>
			<p>And the Nose said, “There is no mountain, I cannot smell it.”</p>
			<p>Then the Eye turned the other way, and they all began to talk together about the Eye’s strange delusion. And they said, “Something must be the matter with the Eye.”</p>

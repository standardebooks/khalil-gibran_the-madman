			<h2 epub:type="title">The Pomegranate</h2>
			<p>Once when I was living in the heart of a pomegranate, I heard a seed saying, “Someday I shall become a tree, and the wind will sing in my branches, and the sun will dance on my leaves, and I shall be strong and beautiful through all the seasons.”</p>
			<p>Then another seed spoke and said, “When I was as young as you, I too held such views; but now that I can weigh and measure things, I see that my hopes were vain.”</p>
			<p>And a third seed spoke also, “I see in us nothing that promises so great a future.”</p>
			<p>And a fourth said, “But what a mockery our life would be, without a greater future!”</p>
			<p>Said a fifth, “Why dispute what we shall be, when we know not even what we are.”</p>
			<p>But a sixth replied, “Whatever we are, that we shall continue to be.”</p>
			<p>And a seventh said, “I have such a clear idea how everything will be, but I cannot put it into words.”</p>
			<p>Then an eight spoke⁠—and a ninth⁠—and a tenth⁠—and then many⁠—until all were speaking, and I could distinguish nothing for the many voices.</p>
			<p>And so I moved that very day into the heart of a quince, where the seeds are few and almost silent.</p>

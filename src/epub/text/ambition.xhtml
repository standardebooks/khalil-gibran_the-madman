			<h2 epub:type="title">Ambition</h2>
			<p>Three men met at a tavern table. One was a weaver, another a carpenter and the third a ploughman.</p>
			<p>Said the weaver, “I sold a fine linen shroud today for two pieces of gold. Let us have all the wine we want.”</p>
			<p>“And I,” said the carpenter, “I sold my best coffin. We will have a great roast with the wine.”</p>
			<p>“I only dug a grave,” said the ploughman, “but my patron paid me double. Let us have honey cakes too.”</p>
			<p>And all that evening the tavern was busy, for they called often for wine and meat and cakes. And they were merry.</p>
			<p>And the host rubbed his hands and smiled at his wife; for his guests were spending freely.</p>
			<p>When they left the moon was high, and they walked along the road singing and shouting together.</p>
			<p>The host and his wife stood in the tavern door and looked after them.</p>
			<p>“Ah!” said the wife, “these gentlemen! So freehanded and so gay! If only they could bring us such luck every day! Then our son need not be a tavern-keeper and work so hard. We could educate him, and he could become a priest.”</p>

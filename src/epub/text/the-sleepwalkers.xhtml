			<h2 epub:type="title">The Sleepwalkers</h2>
			<p>In the town where I was born lived a woman and her daughter, who walked in their sleep.</p>
			<p>One night, while silence enfolded the world, the woman and her daughter, walking, yet asleep, met in their mist-veiled garden.</p>
			<p>And the mother spoke, and she said: “At last, at last, my enemy! You by whom my youth was destroyed⁠—who have built up your life upon the ruins of mine! Would I could kill you!”</p>
			<p>And the daughter spoke, and she said: “O hateful woman, selfish and old! Who stand between my freer self and me! Who would have my life an echo of your own faded life! Would you were dead!”</p>
			<p>At that moment a cock crew, and both women awoke. The mother said gently, “Is that you, darling?” And the daughter answered gently, “Yes, dear.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">God</h2>
			<p>In the ancient days, when the first quiver of speech came to my lips, I ascended the holy mountain and spoke unto God, saying, “Master, I am thy slave. Thy hidden will is my law and I shall obey thee forever more.”</p>
			<p>But God made no answer, and like a mighty tempest passed away.</p>
			<p>And after a thousand years I ascended the holy mountain and again spoke unto God, saying, “Creator, I am thy creation. Out of clay hast thou fashioned me and to thee I owe mine all.”</p>
			<p>And God made no answer, but like a thousand swift wings passed away.</p>
			<p>And after a thousand years I climbed the holy mountain and spoke unto God again, saying, “Father, I am thy son. In pity and love thou hast given me birth, and through love and worship I shall inherit thy kingdom.”</p>
			<p>And God made no answer, and like the mist that veils the distant hills he passed away.</p>
			<p>And after a thousand years I climbed the sacred mountain and again spoke unto God, saying, “My God, my aim and my fulfillment; I am thy yesterday and thou are my tomorrow. I am thy root in the earth and thou art my flower in the sky, and together we grow before the face of the sun.”</p>
			<p>Then God leaned over me, and in my ears whispered words of sweetness, and even as the sea that enfoldeth a brook that runneth down to her, he enfolded me.</p>
			<p>And when I descended to the valleys and the plains God was there also.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Scarecrow</h2>
			<p>Once I said to a scarecrow, “You must be tired of standing in this lonely field.”</p>
			<p>And he said, “The joy of scaring is a deep and lasting one, and I never tire of it.”</p>
			<p>Said I, after a minute of thought, “It is true; for I too have known that joy.”</p>
			<p>Said he, “Only those who are stuffed with straw can know it.”</p>
			<p>Then I left him, not knowing whether he had complimented or belittled me.</p>
			<p>A year passed, during which the scarecrow turned philosopher.</p>
			<p>And when I passed by him again I saw two crows building a nest under his hat.</p>

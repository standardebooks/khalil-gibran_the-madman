			<h2 epub:type="title">Faces</h2>
			<p>I have seen a face with a thousand countenances, and a face that was but a single countenance as if held in a mould.</p>
			<p>I have seen a face whose sheen I could look through to the ugliness beneath, and a face whose sheen I had to lift to see how beautiful it was.</p>
			<p>I have seen an old face much lined with nothing, and a smooth face in which all things were graven.</p>
			<p>I know faces, because I look through the fabric my own eye weaves, and behold the reality beneath.</p>

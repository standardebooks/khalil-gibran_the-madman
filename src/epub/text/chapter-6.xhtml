			<h2>The Wise Dog</h2>
			<p>One day there passed by a company of cats a wise dog.</p>
			<p>And as he came near and saw that they were very intent and heeded him not, he stopped.</p>
			<p>Then there arose in the midst of the company a large, grave cat and looked upon them and said, “Brethren, pray ye; and when ye have prayed again and yet again, nothing doubting, verily then it shall rain mice.”</p>
			<p>And when the dog heard this he laughed in his heart and turned from them saying, “O blind and foolish cats, has it not been written and have I not known and my fathers before me, that that which raineth for prayer and faith and supplication is not mice but bones.”</p>

					<span>Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Defeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not to be trapped by withering laurels.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in you I have found aloneness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the joy of being shunned and scorned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Defeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In your eyes I have read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to be enthroned is to be enslaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to be understood is to be leveled down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to be grasped is but to reach one’s fullness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Defeat, my Defeat, my bold companion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And urging of seas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of mountains that burn in the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You and I shall laugh together with the storm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we shall stand in the sun with a will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we shall be dangerous.</span>
